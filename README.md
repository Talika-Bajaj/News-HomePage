# Frontend Mentor - News homepage

![Design preview for the News homepage coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 34th Frontend Mentor Challenge.

I completed a Frontend Mentor challenge by building a news homepage, which provided an excellent opportunity to practice my CSS Grid skills. The project involved making tricky design decisions and offered plenty of learning opportunities. Additionally, I utilized JavaScript to enhance the interactivity of various elements, resulting in a dynamic and engaging user experience.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
